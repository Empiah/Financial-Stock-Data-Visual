Financial-Stock-Data-Visual

Provides some detailed information on a ticker that is supplied by the user. It will pull the data, and show information including MACD and RSI, and also when those indicators would suggest buying or selling (shown on the grap with arrows). If both of the measures indicate something at the same time it will be shown on the main chart.
